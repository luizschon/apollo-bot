# Apollo Bot

A Discord music bot under development.

## Vision

An easy to use, reliable, efficient and accurate (avoid random search results) music bot to have in your discord server.
This is meant to be a small, free software project, so you will probably be required to host your own local instance or
run it on the cloud a.k.a. not a service that you subscribe to.

## Ideas

Manage discord users favorites, playlists and such things (maybe like Spotify). Will probably need handle a per user
list of these songs in a database.

Maybe an UI in a idependent server channel. This may be naive, since I know basically nothing about Discord's API
capabilities and it seems hard to manage with multiple bots in a server.
